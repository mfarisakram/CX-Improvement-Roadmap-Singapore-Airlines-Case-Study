# Introduction
Aviation and travel are my greatest passions. I view the entire passenger journey as a series of crucial touchpoints: from ticket purchase and airport arrival to the check-in process, the comfort of the in-flight seat and meal, and the overall onboard services. I always aim for seamless service and expect a high level of comfort, especially when paying a premium for the experience. However, particularly on long-haul flights, a consistently excellent experience is not always guaranteed.
